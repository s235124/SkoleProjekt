/*Middleware in Next.js sits before your app‚Äôs rendering logic‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs an SSR page, a static page, or a client‚Äëside transition. Here‚Äôs how it weaves into the overall flow:

    Incoming HTTP Request

        Browser requests GET /teacherstuff/123/modules or any URL in your app.

    Edge Middleware Runs First

        Next.js hands the raw NextRequest to your middleware() function (running at the edge).

        Your code can inspect cookies, headers, path, etc., then decide to:

            return NextResponse.next() ‚Üí let the request continue to rendering

            return NextResponse.redirect(...) ‚Üí send back a 3xx response immediately

            return NextResponse.rewrite(...) ‚Üí silently change the path that will be rendered

            return NextResponse.error() ‚Üí send a 500

    Static File Check

        If you called NextResponse.next(), the router next checks if the URL maps to a static asset (/public/*) or a file in public/. If so, it serves that directly.

    Routing & Data Fetch

        If not a static file, Next matches the URL to a page in your /app or /pages directory.

        For App Router, it begins server‚Äëcomponent rendering (or serves an SSG/ISR snapshot if enabled).

    Server‚ÄëComponent Rendering

        Any Server Components, data‚Äëfetch calls, or getServerSideProps run now, producing HTML + flight payload.

    Response Sent

        The HTML starts streaming back to the client, along with the minimal JS needed to hydrate client components.

    Client Hydration

        Once the browser downloads your JS bundles, React hydrates the HTML into a fully interactive app.

    Client‚ÄëSide Transitions

        If you click a <Link>, Next fetches only the new Flight JSON, bypasses middleware on that transition (only the edge middleware in app/middleware.ts reruns if the path changes), and patches the UI client‚Äëside‚Äîno full refresh.

Why Middleware First?

    Security: Block unauthorized users early, before any page or data‚Äëfetch runs.

    Performance: Edge functions run geographically close to the user, making redirections or rewrites lightning fast.

    Simplicity: Centralizes auth, A/B tests, redirects, or feature‚Äëflag logic in one place, separate from your page code.

By intercepting requests at the edge before routing or data‚Äëfetching, middleware ensures that only valid, authorized traffic ever reaches your React rendering pipeline. 


a jwt is at the most simple level three parts a header, payload and a signature  <header>.<payload>.<signature>
the header is a json object that contains two parts, the type of token and the signing algorithm being used. for example if we use HMAC SHA256 as our signing algorithm, then
the header can look like this:
{
  "alg": "HS256", // algorithm used to sign the token most common is HMAC SHA256
  "typ": "JWT"
}
the payload is the data we want to send, in this case it is the user id and role of the user, this is what we use to determine what routes they can access
example payload:
{
  "user_id": 123,
  "role": 2
  "iat": 1633072800, // issued at time in seconds since epoch
  "exp": 1633076400 // expiration time in seconds since epoch
}
the signature is used to verify that the sender of the jwt is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way. To create the signature part, you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, and the algorithm specified in the header and sign that.
For example if we use HMAC SHA256 the signature will look like this:
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
the secret is stored in our .env file and is used to sign the token when we create it, and to verify it when we decode it. 
when you concatenate the header and payload you get a string that looks like this:
eyJhbGci
since it was signed with the secret, you can verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way.
how do we know that it wasnt changed along the way? well we can verify the signature and use the algorithm and secret that we used to create the token to create a new signature and compare it to the one that was sent. if they match, then we know that the token is valid and has not been tampered with.
when we create the token we use the jsonwebtoken library to sign it, and when we decode it we use the jose library to verify it.
the jose library is a more modern library that is compatible with the edge runtime, while jsonwebtoken is not. 
the jose library uses the same algorithm as jsonwebtoken to verify the token, so we can use it to verify the token we created with jsonwebtoken.
the jose library also has a built in function to decode the token, which we use to get the payload and verify the token at the same time.

    User logs in
    Your server verifies the credentials (e.g. via Passport‚Äôs Local Strategy), then issues a JWT signed with a server‚Äëside secret.

    Client stores the token
    Usually in an HttpOnly cookie or localStorage.

    Authenticated requests
    On each subsequent request, the client sends the JWT‚Äîeither in the Authorization: Bearer ‚Ä¶ header or as a cookie.

    Server verifies
    Middleware (e.g. Passport‚ÄëJWT or jose) checks the signature and claims (expiration, issuer). If valid, it loads req.user and proceeds; otherwise it rejects the request.

üîê Why It‚Äôs Secure

    Integrity: Because the token is signed, you can detect any tampering.

    Stateless: No server‚Äëside session store required; all auth info is in the token.

    Scoped: You control what claims you include‚Äîuser roles, permissions, tenant IDs, etc.

    Expiration: Tokens carry their own expiry (exp claim), so they automatically become invalid.

üìã When to Use

    Single Sign‚ÄëOn (SSO) across multiple domains or microservices.

    APIs where you prefer stateless, high‚Äëperformance auth.

    Mobile clients that need a lightweight, self‚Äëcontained credential.
